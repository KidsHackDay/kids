#Steps

# Glue template to cardboard
Apply some spray glue to the template and attach it to the cardboard.

Attention! Apply the spray in an open area and cover the surfaces around it, otherwise you will make a mess!

## Drill holes for the leds

## Cut out the template

## Cut the other cardboard
Use the template as a reference, draw around it using a pen.

## Insert the leds in the holes

Attention! The longer leg of the led (positive) needs to go on the **outer** side of the cardboard. Use the picture bellow as a reference.

When you are done inserting all the leds, fold their legs so they are secured:

## Using the double sided tape, attach the small cardboard pieces

They should go in the space between the leds

![img_2335](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900042/41f256d6-6422-11e4-9f81-f3ffd20654f6.JPG)

## Cut 2 pieces of wire

They should be a big bigger than the amount needed to go around the circle

![img_2334](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900038/41e56a8e-6422-11e4-98b8-0e6849e8e0e0.JPG)

## Place the wire around the positive side of the leds

* Secure one of the ends of the wire with tape
* Leave the other end a bit longer

## Solder the wire

Attention! Don't do this whith the supervision of one of the facilitators 

![img_2339](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900043/41fc6a5e-6422-11e4-8344-5eb058b170ef.JPG)

## Place the second wire and solder it

Use the image bellow as a reference

![img_2341](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900045/420bd9c6-6422-11e4-8d80-02d76cee8048.JPG)

## Attach a pice of copper tape to the cardboard

Attention! The tape must be under the **inner** wire

![img_2342](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900046/420e917a-6422-11e4-829f-3afe2cf79baa.JPG)

## Solder the wire to the tape

Use a piece of tape to make sure the wire is really close to the tape

![img_2343](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900047/420edcc0-6422-11e4-906b-ca1fafcbc02a.JPG)

## Place some copper tape on the other cardboard

And solder it, using the same technique used before.

![img_2344](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900048/421736c2-6422-11e4-9e35-c3d8e4d1de11.JPG)

![img_2345](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900050/421c46da-6422-11e4-9678-5e36f2bc7917.JPG)

## Attach the battery to the copper tape

Use tape just **around** the battery, keeping the connection exposed

Attention! Make sure the battery is in the same position as in the image, otherwise the lights won't work. Leds are polarized!

![img_2346](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900051/4224017c-6422-11e4-8987-6692b8c347bf.JPG)

![img_2347](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122277/4900053/422b25d8-6422-11e4-9644-9d771efde65a.JPG)

## Test your connection

At this point try to place the 2 pieces of cardboard together and test the connection. The leds should light up when press the cardboards together.

## Improve the connector

If you notice the lights don't light up properly, you might need some extra connectivity.

Roll a pice of copper tape (keep the sticky side inside, as it doesn't conduct eletricity) and attach it to the battery using tape. Test again. You might need to adjust it until it's perfect.

## Attach the 2 pieces of cardboard

Use double sided tape just like before.

## Finishing

Place some black tape around the edges to make it look perfect!
