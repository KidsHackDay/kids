#Code Examples
To be able to run the examples, you need to have set up Codebender correctly. In case you didn't, please visit our [Getting Started guid]()

If you want to edit the code, you will need to click on the "Clone & Edit" button that will be displayed on the top right corner of the code window. You will need to clone both the code and the libraries.

In case you see some expected errors when cloning the examples, you might need to reinstall the Quirkbot library. To do so, please download it [here](https://github.com/KidsHackDay/Quirkbot/archive/master.zip) and then upload it on the "Personal Libraries" area of your profile page on Codebender.
