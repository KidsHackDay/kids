#Code Examples

## Before you start
To be able to run the examples, you need to first have Codebender working correctly. In case you don't (or don't have a clue of what we are talking about), please visit our [Getting Started guide](gtting-started.md).

## Editing code
If you want to edit the code, you will need to click on the "Clone & Edit" button that will be displayed on the top right corner of the code window. You will need to clone both the code and the libraries.

## Examples
1. [Led](examples/led.md)
2. [Led Pulse](examples/led-pulse.md)
3. [Servo](examples/servo.md)
4. [Sonar](examples/sonar.md)
5. [Servo controlled by Sonar](examples/servo-sonar.md)

Attention: In case you see some unexpected errors after cloning the examples, you might need to reinstall the Quirkbot library manually. To do so, download it and upload it on the "Personal Libraries" area of your profile page on Codebender.
