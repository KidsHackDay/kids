# Hello World!

*09/10/2014 by Murilo*

Hello there you all! Today we launched our Innovation Club Wiki and this means a lot. First it's a common place wher you can find what's going on around all the clubs around the world (so far we have 2). Second is a place where we can put some cool inspirations, tutorials and register all that has been done during the club. Third and not less important, we want to create a cool place where cool kids can hang out and chill while they watch some ~craaazy~ stuff other kids from the other side of the world did!

If you are a kid (or feel like a kid), be welcome, bere you can find others like you! If you are an adult (but not a boring one), you are also welcome! Here you will be able to check what big things this little fellas are doing.
