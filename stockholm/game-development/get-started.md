# Wawaweewa! I want to start coding right now!

But first let's check if you have everything you need.

## 1. Minecraft

Yes, you will need Minecraft installed and not only that, you need a specific version of it: 1.7.2. You can [create a profile](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/unmodified-minecraft-client/1861947-the-new-launcher-what-you-need-to-know) for that.

## 2. Connect to a ScriptCraft server

### Connecting on KHD server

If you have access to one of our servers you will know a secret url and we will have you on our whitelist, otherwise you won't be able to connect. Sorry :( 

But you can always request permission sending an email to murilo@kidshackday.com with your name and nickname.

### Connecting to a local server

Follow [this instructions](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server) to setup a CraftBukkit server and install [this plugin](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/README.md#installation) by unziping the `.jar` inside the folder `plugins` at your CraftBukkit installation.

## 3. Drink water

When you come back you can check our [guides](guides.md), [gallery](gallery.md) or try one of our [challenges](challenges.md).
