# Wawaweewa! I want to start coding right now!

But first let's check if you have everything you need.

## 1. Minecraft

![](http://blog.nopdesign.sk/en/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/orly-mini.jpg)

Yes, you will need Minecraft installed and not only that, you need a specific version of it: 1.7.2. You can [create a profile](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/unmodified-minecraft-client/1861947-the-new-launcher-what-you-need-to-know) for that.

## 2. Python installed

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.

Python is great, fast and **super ultra** easy to learn :)

[Follow this instructions to install it](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

## 3. Download our library

Download this library [here](https://github.com/KidsHackDay/minecraft/archive/master.zip) (or check the [source code](https://github.com/KidsHackDay/minecraft)) and unzip it wherever in your computer. We suggest you to keep in a place easy to access like your desktop or your personal folder.

## 4. Install the dependencies

First of all, [install pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html).
Then you need to install Numpy.
If you are on MacOS or Linux, type this on terminal:
<code>sudo pip install numpy</code>
If you are on Windows type this:
<code>pip install numpy</code>

## 5. Run your first program!

Now it's time! Let's run your first lines of code to check if everything is working.

Remember that you can't run this code on normal Minecraft servers, it must be either on a Raspberry Pi with Minecraft Pi Edition or connected to a CraftBukkit server with Raspberry Juice plugin installed.

Go to where you unziped our library, search for a folder called `khd` and then a file named `config.py`. Open this file with your favorite text editor (we suggest this if you are using Windows, this one if you are using Linux and this other one if you are using MacOS) and follow the instructions written on this file.

After that, navigate with your terminal (if you don't know how to do it, google it) where our library was unziped and type `python clear.py`. If no errors were printed on terminal, you are ready to rule the world and start writing your code.

### Connecting on KHD server

If you have access to one of our servers you will know a secret url and we will have you on our whitelist, otherwise you won't be able to connect. Sorry :( 

But you can always request permission sending an email to murilo@kidshackday.com.


### Connecting to a local server

Follow [this instructions](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server) to setup a CraftBukkit server and install [this plugin](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/raspberryjuice/) by unziping the `.jar` inside the folder `plugins` at your CraftBukkit installation.

## 6. Drink water

It may take from 30 minutes to 3 hours to setup everything and you probably didn't drink water during this time so, go to the kichen, grab a glass of water, play a bit with your dog, call a friend and invite him to join you, I don't know but just give a break, it will make things much better when you come back!

You can go now. We are waiting here.

When you come back you can check our [guides](guides.md), [gallery](gallery.md) or try one of our [challenges](challenges.md).
