# Are you lost? Here we have some answers.

## What is this site?

This site will help you to write mini-games inside Minecraft. If you want to see what kind of amazing games we already did, please check out our [Gallery](gallery.md)! If you have another great idea for a game, [start now!](getting-started.md).

## How can I write my own Minecraft Mod?

There are too many ways to write your own mod but unfortunately, we won't focus on that. We can help you to do [this kind of stuff](gallery.md).

## Do I need setup my own server?

To be able to use python to program inside Minecraft, you will need a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) or a [CraftBukkit](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server) server with a plugin called [Raspberry Juice](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/raspberryjuice/).

You can install a [CraftBukkit](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server) on your computer to play alone, it's not very complicated but requires you to know a little bit how to work on terminal (I can tell you it's super cool!). Otherwise you can apply to use one of our KHD servers for free. Just send an email to murilo@kidshackday.com.

## How can I start programming my first game?

**I tought you would never ask this!**

If you never ever ever tryed to write a program, [start here](get-started.md).
<!-- But maybe you already wrote or read some crazy codes, then you can [start here](get-started.md). -->
Nah... I already have everything installed and executed the examples but I don't know what can I do or how should I start creating my own things, check our [guides](guides.md).
Seriously, if you are a professional hacker, jump straight to [our challenges](challenges.md).

Right now we are working in a way to everyone be able to edit our gallery but, outch... This is hard. Anyway if you send your game code, pictures, video or screencast to murilo@kidshackday.com, you can be sure it will be there!

## Do I need to pay for something?

Nothing except for Minecraft licence. But if you are attending to one of our events you can play for free with one of our accounts.

## What is Kids Hack Day?

Inspired by the global hackerspace movement and the lack of technology-related play and creativity in the classroom, Kids Hack Day is a means of closing the gap between education and technological creativity. We aim to revolutionize how we immerse children in emerging technologies.
